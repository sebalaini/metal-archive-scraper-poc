This project was initiated to compare the local music library in macOS with the data available on www.metal-archives.com, aiming to identify the availability of new albums.

However, this is merely a proof of concept and is currently non-functional due to Metal Archives being protected by CloudFlare's bot detection, which prevents the retrieval of accurate data.
